# Drum Machine

The app is an implementation of a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).
Stack I've used: Vite + TS + React + Chakra UI

To run locally you can simply type in your console:
```bash
yarn dev
```
